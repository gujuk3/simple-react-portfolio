      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
          My name is Ahmet Serdar Turan, and I am a 24-year-old undergraduate student in Computer Engineering
          at Rumeli University, Istanbul, Turkey.  My academic interests center on machine learning (ML), deep learning
          (DL), computer vision (CV), and algorithms, with a strong commitment to advancing in these fields.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am the first author of an IEEE conference paper titled “An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Analyzing
          Students' Academic Performance Using Machine Learning Algorithms.” This work reflects my dedication to
          applying AI methodologies to meaningful real-world challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am proficient in Python, Java, and C++, while also having experience with JavaScript and C. My long-term
          goal is to pursue a master’s degree in Machine Learning, with particular focus on computer vision or large
          language models (LLMs), to contribute to both academic research and industry innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
          Outside of academics, I enjoy solving Sudoku puzzles, which strengthens my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
